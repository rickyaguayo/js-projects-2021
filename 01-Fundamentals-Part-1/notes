HTML + CSS + JS = Noun + Verb + Adjective
HTML = what is on the page
CSS = what it looks like
JS = what it does

Modern JS frameworks/libraries
Ex: React, Angular, Vue
- make building large scale apps easier/faster
- all 100% based on JS

JS and web browser are 2 different things
- JS can be used outside of the web browser
- JS can be used on a web server. Ex: node.js
  - helps us build back end apps
    - runs on web server
    - interacts with databases
- JS on the browser are front end apps

JS Native mobile/desktop apps
- uses native components instead of web components as building blocks
- Mobile: React Native, Ionic
- Desktop: Electron

ES6
- stands for ECMAScript
- came out in 2015. Biggest update for JS ever

Naming
- variable cannot start with a number
  - Ex: 3years will throw error in the console
- variables can only contain numbers, letters, _ or $
- cannot be the same as reserved keywords
  - Ex: function, new
  - can be worked around by adding $ or _ before it. $function
  - 'name' is allowed but advised against. Use things like firstName, etc
- do not start var/let/const names with uppercase letter 
- all caps variable names are reserved for variables that never change
  - Ex: let PI = 3.1415; 
- be specific with your variable names. myFirstJob vs job1. the first one is better because it is more specific

Data Types
 - every value is either an object or a primitive
  - a primitive is everything but an object
 - 7 Primitive Data Types
    1. Number
    2. Strings - sequence of characters. wrapped in single or double quotes
    3. Boolean - true or false value
    4. undefined - value taken by a variable that is not defined. empty value
    5. null - also empty value
    6. Symbol - value that is unique and cannot be changed
    7. BigInt - larger integers that the number type cant hold
- dynamic typing - in js, you dont have to manually define the data type of the value within a variable. Data types are auto determined
- value has the type, not the variable
- empty variables hold undefined type/value
