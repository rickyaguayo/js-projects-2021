- these kinds of methods ARE NOT js. they are web APIs that can interact with JS
.querySelector() - selects a class within HTML
.textContent - displays text within selected element
.value - gets value from HTML element
.addEventListener(type, listener) - listens for events and reacts (with a function) when event appears
  Ex: .addEventListener('click', fucntion(){
    do stuff
  });
  - click is what the event listener is looking for. 
  - can be other things like mouse movement, scroll, etc
  - does not need to be called. the JS engine will run the function attached to the event listener when the event happens
.style - changes CSS
  Ex: document.querySelector('.class').style.backgroundColor = 'green';
  - css attributes that have more than one word should be camel case.
  - the value should be a string (within quotes)

DOM - Document Object Model
- connection between JS and HTML docs
- allows js to access HTML elements/styles and manipulate them

state - all the data that is relevant to the application
