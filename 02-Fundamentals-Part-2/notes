strict mode
- written at the top of js file. 'use strict';
- helps make the js cleaner and secure code
- helps devs avoid bugs
- forbids certain actions
- makes errors visible
- adds reserved words that will throw errors if you try to use them

Functions -
- input data -> transform data -> output data
- allows us to create reusable code 
- names and parameters optional
- can only be ran when called/ran/invoked. logger();
- return helps produce the result of the function so that it can be used elsewhere in the code. return is optional
- return causes you to jump out of function
- functions are values. can be stored in variables

- function declarations (script.js line 10) use function keyword to declare a function (like variables)
  - these can be called before the function is declared in the code (hoisting)

- function expression (script.js line 30) is a function value stored in a variable
  - this usually is an anonymous(without a name) function stored in a variable
  - cannot be called before the function in the code. (hoisting)

- arrow functions (script.js line 38)
  - short hand for function expressions
  - return is implicit in arrow functions. but if there is more than one line of code, you will need to put return
  - curly braces are optional depending on length of code block within function 
  - helpful for writing short one line functions. (dont need return here)
  - arrow functions do not get the this keyword.

Arrays (line 87)
- zero based.
- call items in array with []
- can mutate arrays within const variable
- can hold different kinds of data types
- can use function calls within array
- use for more ordered data

- Methods - functions used to mutate arrays (line 117)
  - .push() - adds item to END of array. returns length of array. shorthand is friends[3]. assuming 3 would be the last index if once value is added
  - .unshift() - adds item to BEGINNING of array. returns length of array
  - .pop() - removes LAST item in array. returns item removed
  - .shift() - removes FIRST item in array. returns item removed
  - .length() - calculates how many values inside of an array. not zero based
  - .indexOf() - returns the index of specified value. -1 is returned when value is not present in the array
  - .includes() - returns true or false. sees whether value is inside the array. uses strict equality operator

Objects - key value pairing (line 134)
- first value is key, second is the value.
- key is also called a property.
- object literal syntax is defining an object with curly braces
- used for more unstructured data
- any function that is attached to an object is called a method
- function inside an object must be an expression not a declaration

- dot notation. operator that calls a certain property from an object. 
ricky.job = 'developer'
- bracket notation allows you to add an expression 
  - useful when something needs to be computed before running

Loops - (line 210)
- controlled structure
- automates repetitive ta sks
- continue - exit the current iteration and continue to the next
- break - jumps out of loop completely

- For Loops
  - keeps running while condition is true
  - has 3 parts to the beginning 
    1. counter - the variable that is the starting point
    2. logical condition that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop 
    3. how the counter is modified after each iteration

- While Loops (line 276)
  - can only use the condition
  - still needs the counter and the increment, but needs to be explicitly defined outside the loop
  - this allows more versatility than a for loop
  - helpful when we dont know how many times the loops needs to be run

- Math.random() gives random number between 0 and 1. can be 0 but never will be 1. Ex: .984223
- Math.trunc() cuts off any decimal or fraction. (no rounding) 4.875 -> 4
- Math.floor() rounds down any number 5.983 -> 5
- Math.ceil() rounds up any number 9.07 -> 10
- Math.round() rounds to the nearest integer 5.75 -> 6, 5.25 -> 5
