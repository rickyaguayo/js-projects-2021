Default parameters
- ES5 way is to define each one using short circuiting
- ES6 way is to define them where the arguments are presented
- can contain any expression
- can use parameters that are defined BEFORE itself
    Ex: const x = function(
      flightNum, 
      numPassengers = 1, 
      price = 199 * numPassengers)
    {};
- to skip a default parameter, use undefined when passing in arguments



Closures - makes sure that function doesnt lose connection to variables that existed at the functions birth place

- has access to the variable environment of the execution context in which it was created
- VE attached to the function, exactly as it was at the time and place the function was created
-
